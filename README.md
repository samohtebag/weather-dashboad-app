## 1. Description

This is a weather dashboard I built using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Moment.JS, and API Usage from Open Weather Map.

When a user types the name of the city, and then clicks the search button, they are presented with the current weather information
of the city, in real-time. We show the city name, and the weather icon next to the city name indicating the weather. Next,
we show current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.

We also show a 5 day forecast, displaying the date of that forecast alongside the temperature and humidity of that day as well, plus an icon displaying the weather of that day.
